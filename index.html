			Your choice of rare or well-done, nothing less and nothing more. Only two choices so diners would not be spoilt. Sauce of the year would be a dash of freshly grated wasabi and a chunk of Himalayan sea salt to taste. Diners may bring their own sauce and corkage fees apply.

			Chef's specialty of the month would be the salmon aburi nigiri. Freshly-sliced salmon is coated with house's spcial mentai sauce, thereafter lightly torched. Thus alternating the chemical structure of the salmon fats to such an extent that when you place it in your mouth, it literally melts in your mouth! A sure-pleaser.
